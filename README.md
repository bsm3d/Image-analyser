# Image Analyzer
Version 1.0 (2025)
By Benoît (BSM3D) Saint-Moulin 

## Overview

Image Analyzer emerges as a revolutionary web application designed to tackle one of the most pressing challenges in the digital age: identifying images generated by artificial intelligence. In a world where visual content is increasingly complex and potentially deceptive, this tool offers a sophisticated, transparent approach to image authentication.

The application represents a paradigm shift in how we understand and verify digital imagery. By employing multiple analytical vectors, Image Analyzer provides users with a comprehensive toolkit for examining the origins and authenticity of visual content. It goes beyond simple detection, offering a nuanced, probabilistic assessment that empowers users to make informed judgments about the images they encounter.

## Privacy & Security

The tool stands in stark contrast to conventional image detection solutions. Where many commercial products rely on invasive data collection and complex, opaque algorithms, Image Analyzer is built on a foundation of transparency, user privacy, and ethical technology development.

Key privacy principles include 100% client-side processing, meaning all analysis occurs directly within the user's browser. There is no data storage, no cloud uploads, and no registration requirements. The entire application is free to use and comes with publicly available source code, allowing for complete transparency and community verification.

- 100% Client-side processing
- No AI model training
- No data storage or cloud upload
- No registration required
- Free to use, code publicly available

**Note**: This tool provides probability-based analysis and should be used as part of a broader verification process, not as a standalone proof of image authenticity.

## Analysis Methods Explained

### Understanding the Analysis Metrics

Image Analyzer uses a multi-vector approach with **seven core analysis categories** (scoring up to 100 points total). Each category examines specific characteristics that distinguish AI-generated images from real photographs.

#### 1. Pattern Analysis (25 points max)
**What it detects:**
- **Repeating Patterns**: Identifies unnaturally repetitive visual elements common in AI generation
- **Sharp Edges**: Measures edge sharpness and artificial transitions

**How to interpret:**
- ⚠️ **High scores (>12 points)**: Strong indication of repeating patterns typical of AI
- ✓ **Low scores (<8 points)**: Natural variation suggests authentic photography
- Threshold: `repeatingPatterns > 0.35` or `sharpEdges > 0.18` triggers detection

#### 2. Texture Analysis (20 points max)
**What it detects:**
- **Uniformity**: Measures texture consistency across the image
- **Unnatural Gradients**: Detects mathematically perfect color transitions
- **Complexity**: Analyzes texture detail level

**How to interpret:**
- ⚠️ **High uniformity (>0.7)**: AI tends to create overly smooth textures
- ⚠️ **Perfect gradients (>0.45)**: Suggests algorithmic generation
- ✓ **High complexity (>0.25)**: Natural textures have irregular detail
- AI-generated images often score 12-16 points in this category

#### 3. Color Analysis (20 points max)
**What it detects:**
- **Color Banding**: Identifies posterization and limited color gradations
- **Unique Colors**: Counts distinct color values (real photos typically have 1000+ unique colors)
- **Saturation Variance**: Measures variation in color saturation

**How to interpret:**
- ⚠️ **Few unique colors (<400)**: AI often optimizes to limited palette
- ⚠️ **High color banding (>0.35)**: Suggests color quantization
- ⚠️ **Low saturation variance (<0.08)**: Unnatural color consistency
- Real photos typically have high color diversity and natural variation

#### 4. Symmetry Detection (8 points max)
**What it detects:**
- **Horizontal/Vertical Symmetry**: Measures bilateral symmetry in the image

**How to interpret:**
- ⚠️ **High symmetry (>0.85)**: AI generators often create unnaturally symmetric compositions
- ✓ **Natural asymmetry (<0.70)**: Real-world scenes rarely have perfect symmetry
- Particularly useful for detecting AI-generated faces, architecture, and centered compositions

#### 5. Noise Analysis (10 points max)
**What it detects:**
- **Artificial Noise**: Identifies regular, patterned noise characteristic of AI
- **Natural Noise**: Detects random noise from camera sensors

**How to interpret:**
- ⚠️ **High artificial noise (>0.35)**: Suggests algorithmic generation
- ✓ **Natural noise present (>0.05)**: Camera sensor noise indicates real photography
- Real photos have random grain; AI images often have suspiciously clean or patterned noise

#### 6. Compression Artifacts (7 points max)
**What it detects:**
- **Compression Artifacts**: Analyzes JPEG compression patterns
- **Perfect Edges**: Identifies unnaturally clean edges

**How to interpret:**
- ⚠️ **Unusual compression patterns (>0.35)**: May indicate post-generation processing
- ⚠️ **Perfect edges (>0.25)**: Real photos have natural edge degradation
- Note: This metric can be ambiguous as both real and AI images undergo compression

#### 7. JPEG Block Detection (5 points max) - NEW in v1.0
**What it detects:**
- **8x8 DCT Blocks**: Analyzes JPEG compression block boundaries
- **Block Boundary Consistency**: Detects anomalies in compression block patterns

**How to interpret:**
- ⚠️ **High block score (>0.6)**: Unusual JPEG block patterns
- ✓ **Normal blocks (0.3-0.5)**: Expected JPEG compression structure
- AI generators sometimes leave telltale patterns in block boundaries

#### 8. Frequency Analysis (5 points max) - NEW in v1.0
**What it detects:**
- **High-frequency details**: Measures fine detail preservation
- **Smoothness**: Analyzes overall image smoothness

**How to interpret:**
- ⚠️ **Low frequency ratio (<0.15)**: Overly smooth, lacking natural detail
- ✓ **Balanced frequencies**: Real photos maintain detail across frequency spectrum
- AI images often appear "too perfect" with reduced high-frequency content

### Interactive Analysis Tools

#### Visual Overlay Tools
- **Heatmap Visualization**: Color-coded overlay highlighting suspicious regions (red = high AI probability)
- **Edge Detection**: Sobel filter reveals edge characteristics and artifacts
- **Block Analysis**: Visualizes 8x8 compression blocks and repetitive patterns
- **RGB Channel Separation**: Examine individual color channels for inconsistencies

#### Inspection Tools
- **8x Magnification**: Pixel-level inspection with grid overlay for micro-detail analysis
- **Pixel Information**: Real-time RGBA values on hover
- **RGB Histogram**: Real-time color distribution analysis

#### Enhancement Tools
- **Brightness/Contrast Controls**: Reveal hidden artifacts and editing traces
- **Blacklight UV Mode**: Simulates ultraviolet light to expose fluorescent anomalies
- **Infrared Mode**: False-color IR visualization for material inconsistencies

### Score Interpretation Guidelines

**Total Score Range: 0-100 points**

- **0-30 points**: Likely authentic photograph
  - Multiple natural characteristics
  - Random noise patterns
  - Natural color variance
  - EXIF data present (strong indicator)

- **31-50 points**: Inconclusive / Borderline
  - Mixed indicators
  - May be edited photo or simple AI generation
  - Requires manual inspection with tools
  - Check EXIF data and metadata

- **51-70 points**: Probably AI-generated
  - Multiple AI indicators present
  - Unnatural patterns detected
  - Limited color palette
  - Use visual tools to verify

- **71-100 points**: Highly likely AI-generated
  - Strong AI characteristics across multiple categories
  - Perfect patterns and symmetry
  - Artificial noise patterns
  - Typically lacks authentic EXIF data

### Best Practice Analysis Workflow

1. **Initial Upload**: Review overall score and category breakdown
2. **EXIF Check**: Verify metadata presence and consistency
3. **Visual Tools**: Use heatmap and edge detection overlays
4. **Magnification**: Inspect suspicious areas at 8x zoom
5. **Color Analysis**: Check RGB histogram and channel separation
6. **Enhancement**: Adjust brightness/contrast to reveal artifacts
7. **Training Mode** (optional): Compare against known real/AI samples

**Important Reminder**: No tool provides 100% certainty. Use this analysis as part of a broader verification process, combining technical metrics with contextual understanding and human judgment.

## Usage Guidelines

### 1. Basic Analysis
